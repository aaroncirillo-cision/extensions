The new extensions are named below:

* nvidia-container-toolkit-lts
* nvidia-open-gpu-kernel-modules-production
* nvidia-open-gpu-kernel-modules-lts
* nonfree-kmod-nvidia-lts

The extensions would ship the latest version of LTS/Production drivers available at the time of Talos release.

Image Factory using an existing schematic id would upgrade the NVIDIA driver and container toolkit to the LTS version.

If production version is required, the schematic id should be updated to the production version.
